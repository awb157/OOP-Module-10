## Description
In this protect I worked on setting up a library for an employee class of Manager (Name, ID, Email), Engineer (Name, ID, Email, github) and Intern (Name, ID, Email and School) and am able to pass and update info in all 3 fields. I made a test for all 3 classes and then made a main for all 3 again.
